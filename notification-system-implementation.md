# Comprehensive Notification System Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the comprehensive notification system for the Assured Response CCM application. The system enhances the existing notification functionality with improved in-app notifications, email integration, user preferences, and role-based notification rules.

## Overview

The notification system has been completely redesigned to provide a professional, intuitive, and user-friendly experience. Key improvements include:

1. **Enhanced In-App Notifications**
   - Improved notification bell with badge count
   - Redesigned notification center with filtering and categorization
   - Support for notification badges on pages/tabs requiring action
   - Proper read/unread status tracking

2. **Email Notification Integration**
   - Integration with the existing email component
   - User-specific email preferences
   - Email digests (daily/weekly) for non-critical notifications
   - Immediate email delivery for critical notifications

3. **User Preferences**
   - Granular control over notification delivery methods
   - Per-notification type preferences
   - Email digest configuration

4. **Role-Based Notification Rules**
   - Different notification types for different user roles
   - Appropriate notification priorities based on content
   - Role-specific default preferences

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The notification system uses the following database tables:

1. **notifications** - Stores individual notifications
2. **notification_types** - Defines the types of notifications
3. **notification_preferences** - Stores user preferences for notifications
4. **notification_badges** - Tracks badge counts for pages/tabs
5. **notification_digests** - Manages email digest schedules
6. **notification_queue** - Queues notifications for email delivery

The database migration is defined in `supabase/migrations/20250525_notification_system_upgrade.sql` and can be run using the `db/run-notification-migration.js` script.

### Backend Services

The notification system includes the following backend services:

1. **send-notification** - Edge function for creating notifications and queueing emails
2. **process-notification-digests** - Edge function for processing email digests

### Frontend Components

The notification system includes the following frontend components:

1. **NotificationBell** - The bell icon in the header with badge count
2. **NotificationCenter** - The slide-out panel for viewing notifications
3. **NotificationItem** - Individual notification item component
4. **NotificationList** - List of notifications with filtering
5. **NotificationPreferencesPanel** - User interface for managing notification preferences

### Hooks and Utilities

The notification system includes the following hooks and utilities:

1. **useNotifications** - Hook for fetching and filtering notifications
2. **useNotificationCount** - Hook for getting notification counts
3. **useNotificationBadges** - Hook for getting notification badges
4. **useNotificationTypes** - Hook for getting notification types
5. **useNotificationPreferences** - Hook for getting and updating notification preferences
6. **useNotificationDigests** - Hook for getting and updating digest settings

## Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the notification system:

### 1. Run the Database Migration

```bash
# Set environment variables
export SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Run the migration
node db/run-notification-migration.js
```

### 2. Deploy the Edge Functions

```bash
# Deploy the send-notification function
supabase functions deploy send-notification

# Deploy the process-notification-digests function
supabase functions deploy process-notification-digests
```

### 3. Set Up Scheduled Tasks

Set up a scheduled task to run the process-notification-digests function:

```bash
# For daily digests (run at 8:00 AM UTC)
supabase functions schedule process-notification-digests "0 8 * * *" --body '{"digestType": "daily"}'

# For weekly digests (run at 9:00 AM UTC on Mondays)
supabase functions schedule process-notification-digests "0 9 * * 1" --body '{"digestType": "weekly"}'
```

## Testing Instructions

Follow these steps to test the notification system:

### 1. Test In-App Notifications

1. Log in to the application
2. Create a notification using the developer console:
   ```javascript
   await fetch('/api/notifications', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       title: 'Test Notification',
       message: 'This is a test notification',
       type: 'INFO',
       category: 'GENERAL'
     })
   });
   ```
3. Verify that the notification appears in the notification center
4. Verify that the notification badge appears on the bell icon
5. Verify that marking the notification as read updates the badge count

### 2. Test Email Notifications

1. Update your notification preferences to enable email notifications
2. Create a high-priority notification
3. Verify that an email is sent to your email address
4. Verify that the email contains the correct content and styling

### 3. Test Notification Preferences

1. Navigate to the notification preferences page
2. Update your preferences for different notification types
3. Create notifications of different types
4. Verify that notifications are delivered according to your preferences

### 4. Test Email Digests

1. Enable daily or weekly email digests in your preferences
2. Create several notifications but don't read them
3. Manually trigger the digest function:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-notification-digests \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-anon-key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"digestType": "daily", "forceProcess": true}'
   ```
4. Verify that you receive a digest email with all your unread notifications
