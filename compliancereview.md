COMPREHENSIVE COMPLIANCE SYSTEM AUDIT COMPLETED
I have completed a full review of all compliance-related components and can confirm the status of user display name fixes and system functionality across the entire compliance ecosystem.

‚úÖ USER DISPLAY NAME FIXES - SUCCESSFULLY DISTRIBUTED
The display name fixes have been properly distributed across all functional compliance components:

ComplianceTierDashboard.tsx: Uses user.display_name || user.email || 'Unknown User' pattern
useComplianceData.ts: Implements consistent userName: issue.profiles?.display_name || 'Unknown User' pattern
complianceTierService.ts: Enhanced with proper user profile fetching including display_name and email fields
ComplianceTierManager.tsx: Receives userName prop for proper display
RequirementReviewQueue.tsx: Uses submission.user_name pattern (though component is currently broken due to missing hooks)
Result: No more "NaN" values or UUID display issues in functional components.

üö® CRITICAL SYSTEM ISSUES DISCOVERED
1. BROKEN COMPONENTS (Runtime Failures)

RequirementReviewQueue.tsx: Imports non-existent useSubmissionsToReview and useRequirementReview hooks
ComplianceProgressDashboard.tsx: Imports non-existent useComplianceProgress and useComplianceActivity hooks
2. BUILD FAILURES (Import Path Issues)

TierAdvancementSection.tsx: Uses incorrect ./components/ui/ paths instead of @/components/ui/
TierBenefitsOverview.tsx: Uses incorrect ./components/ui/ paths instead of @/components/ui/
‚úÖ WORKING COMPLIANCE COMPONENTS (11/15)
ComplianceTierDashboard.tsx - SA dashboard (FIXED & WORKING)
ComplianceTierManager.tsx - Administrative tier management
ComplianceMilestoneTracker.tsx - Gamification system
ExternalLinkRequirement.tsx - External system integration
FileUploadRequirement.tsx - File upload functionality
FormRequirement.tsx - Dynamic form generation
RequirementDetailDrawer.tsx - Comprehensive requirement details
TierRequirementSection.tsx - Requirement sectioning
TierStatusHeader.tsx - Status display
TierComparisonChart.tsx - Tier comparison visualization
Compliance.tsx - Main compliance page (SA/AD/AP access confirmed)
üìä SA/AD/AP ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS REVIEW
‚úÖ WORKING ADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES:

Compliance Tier Management: SA/AD/AP can switch user tiers between basic/robust
Statistics Dashboard: Real-time compliance metrics and KPIs visible
User Overview: Proper display names showing instead of UUIDs
Tier Comparison: Visual comparison tools for different compliance levels
‚ùå MISSING ADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES:

Review Queue System: Currently broken due to missing hooks
Individual Progress Monitoring: Not functional due to missing hooks
Communication Features: No evidence of SA/AD/AP communication tools for compliance management
User Notification System: No compliance-specific communication components found
üéØ COMPLIANCE SYSTEM HEALTH: 73% FUNCTIONAL
Core compliance functionality works for individual users, but administrative oversight capabilities are partially broken.
