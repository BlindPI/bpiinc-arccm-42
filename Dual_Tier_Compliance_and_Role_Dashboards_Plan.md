# Comprehensive Plan for Dual-Tier Compliance and Role-Specific Dashboard Integration

Based on your findings and the provided `DUAL_TIER_COMPLIANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, this document outlines a full and exhaustive plan for the completion of the dual-tier compliance implementation, along with detailed next steps for dashboard and user integration for the IT (Instructor Trainee), IP (Instructor Provisional), and IC (Instructor Certified) user roles.

The overarching strategy will be to first establish the foundational Dual-Tier Compliance system, and then systematically implement dedicated dashboards and user experiences for each instructor role, building up from the simplest (IT) to the more complex (IC), integrating smoothly with the existing AP (Authorized Provider) functionality.

## Part 1: Dual-Tier Compliance System Implementation (Foundation)

This section details the implementation of the core dual-tier compliance system, as outlined in the `DUAL_TIER_COMPLIANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

### Executive Summary

The dual-tier compliance system will allow administrators to assign either **Basic Compliance** (document requirements only) or **Robust Compliance** (current comprehensive + new document requirements) on a user-by-user basis.

### Key Features
- **Basic Tier**: Resume, background check, basic company info (quick onboarding)
- **Robust Tier**: All current requirements + new document requirements (full certification)
- **User-Level Control**: Administrators can switch tiers per user
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing user management workflow

### Architecture Overview

        B -- Basic --> C[Minimal Requirements: Docs, Background]
        B -- Robust --> D[Comprehensive Requirements: Certs, Training, Docs, CE]
        C -- Status Calculation --> E(Basic Compliance Status)
        D -- Status Calculation --> F(Robust Compliance Status)
        E & F --> G(Overall User Compliance Score)
    end

    subgraph "Tier Management Flow"
        H[Admin Interface] --> I(Select User)
        I --> J{Change Tier?}
        J -- Yes --> K[Assign New Tier]
        K --> L(Update Profile & Requirements)
        L --> M[Compliance Recalculated]
    end
```

### Implementation Phases (as per `DUAL_TIER_COMPLIANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`)

#### **Phase 1: Database Schema Enhancement**
- **Objective:** Add `compliance_tier` column to the `profiles` table and introduce `compliance_templates` table.
- **Key Deliverables:** Updated `profiles` table, new `compliance_templates` table, and associated indices/RLS policies.
- **Relevant Files:** `db/migrations/20250624_add_compliance_tier_support.sql` (New Migration)

#### **Phase 2: Dual Compliance Templates**
- **Objective:** Define specific requirements for 'basic' and 'robust' tiers across all relevant roles (AP, IC, IP, IT).
- **Key Deliverables:** `BASIC_COMPLIANCE_TEMPLATES` and `ROBUST_COMPLIANCE_TEMPLATES` containing detailed requirements for each role and tier. Updated `ComplianceRequirementsService` methods to retrieve tier-specific templates.
- **Relevant Files:** [`src/services/compliance/complianceRequirementsService.ts`](src/services/compliance/complianceRequirementsService.ts)

#### **Phase 3: Compliance Tier Management Service**
- **Objective:** Implement the core logic for assigning, switching, and retrieving compliance tier information for users.
- **Key Deliverables:** `ComplianceTierService` with functions like `assignComplianceTier`, `getUserComplianceTierInfo`, `switchComplianceTier`, and `getAllUsersComplianceTiers`.
- **Relevant Files:** `src/services/compliance/complianceTierService.ts` (New File)

#### **Phase 4: User Interface Components (Core Tier Management)**
- **Objective:** Develop UI components for managing and displaying compliance tier information. _Note: This phase focuses on the generic tier management, not the dedicated role dashboards yet._
- **Key Deliverables:**
    -   **`ComplianceTierManager.tsx`**: Component for administrators to view and change a user's compliance tier.
    -   **User Management Integration**: Update `UserTableRow.tsx` to display compliance tier and integrate the `ComplianceTierManager`.
    -   **`ComplianceTierDashboard.tsx`**: A high-level dashboard showing statistics on basic vs. robust tier users and overall completion rates.
- **Relevant Files:** `src/components/compliance/ComplianceTierManager.tsx` (New File), `src/components/user-management/UserTableRow.tsx` (Update), `src/components/compliance/ComplianceTierDashboard.tsx` (New File)

#### **Phase 5: Testing & Deployment**
- **Objective:** Ensure the reliable functioning and deployment of the dual-tier compliance system.
- **Key Deliverables:** Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, UAT), successful deployment to production environment, and verification of key functionalities.
- **Includes:** Test scripts for tier assignment, switching, and role changes with tier preservation.

#### **Phase 6: Documentation & Training**
- **Objective:** Provide clear guides for administrators and end-users on the new dual-tier compliance system.
- **Key Deliverables:** Administrator Guide (tier assignment, monitoring) and User Guide (understanding tiers, completing requirements).

## Part 2: Detailed Next Steps for IT, IP, IC Dashboard & User Integration

This section extends the previous plan by focusing on the development of dedicated dashboards and comprehensive user integration for the Instructor Trainee (IT), Instructor Provisional (IP), and Instructor Certified (IC) roles. This will ensure each role has a tailored UI/UX experience that leverages the newly implemented dual-tier compliance system.

### Strategic Approach

Following the successful implementation of the core dual-tier compliance system, we will adopt a "bottom-up" approach for role-specific dashboard development:

1.  **Start with IT (Instructor Trainee):** This is likely the simplest role, allowing us to establish foundational patterns and components that can be reused and extended.
2.  **Progress to IP (Instructor Provisional):** Build upon the IT dashboard, adding increased complexity and features relevant to provisional instructors.
3.  **Conclude with IC (Instructor Certified):** Implement the most advanced instructor dashboard, integrating all previous functionalities and unique features for certified instructors.
4.  **Integrate with AP:** Ensure the AP dashboard can seamlessly view and manage users across all new instructor roles.

### Overall Architecture for Role-Specific Dashboards

        D -- "Uses" --> J[Progress Tracking Widget]
        D -- "Integrates with" --> K[ComplianceTierService]
        D -- "Integrates with" --> L[User Profile Service]
        D -- "Integrates with" --> M[Document Management Service]
        
        E -- "Extends" --> D
