# Compliance Management System - Day 1 Deployment Sequence

## Overview

This document outlines the specific deployment sequence for Day 1 of the Compliance Management System implementation. Following this sequence will ensure proper initialization of the dual-tier compliance system.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning deployment, ensure:
- Access to Supabase project with appropriate permissions
- Development environment with necessary credentials
- Backup of the current database state

## Deployment Sequence

### 1. Database Schema Deployment

**Objective**: Deploy the dual-tier compliance database schema

**Steps**:
1. Connect to Supabase database
2. Run the SQL migration file: `20250624_dual_tier_compliance_system.sql`
3. Verify tables were created properly
4. Check indexes and constraints

**Verification Queries**:
```sql
-- Verify tables were created
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name LIKE 'compliance_%';

-- Verify profiles table has compliance_tier column
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'profiles' 
AND column_name = 'compliance_tier';

-- Verify indexes were created
SELECT indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'compliance_templates', 'compliance_requirements', 'user_compliance_records')
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
```

**Expected Results**:
- All tables created: compliance_templates, compliance_tier_history, compliance_requirements, user_compliance_records, etc.
- profiles table has compliance_tier column
- All indexes and constraints properly defined

### 2. Complete and Deploy ComplianceRequirementsService

**Objective**: Implement missing methods in the ComplianceRequirementsService

**Steps**:
1. Update `complianceRequirementsService.ts` with the following methods:
   - getRequirementsTemplateByTier
   - getRequirementsByTemplate
   - getRequirementsByRoleTier
   - initializeTierRequirements
   - logRequirementsActivity
2. Test each method individually
3. Deploy the updated service

**Verification Tests**:
```typescript
// Test getRequirementsTemplateByTier
const template = await ComplianceRequirementsService.getRequirementsTemplateByTier('IT', 'basic');
console.log('Template:', template);

// Test getRequirementsByRoleTier
const requirements = await ComplianceRequirementsService.getRequirementsByRoleTier('IT', 'basic');
console.log(`Found ${requirements.length} requirements`);
```

**Expected Results**:
- Service methods execute without errors
- Template data is properly retrieved
- Requirements are linked to correct templates

### 3. Update Requirement Templates

**Objective**: Complete requirement templates for all roles

**Steps**:
1. Update `initializeComplianceTiers.ts` to include all templates from `CompleteRequirementTemplates.md`
2. Add templates for:
   - IP Basic (3 requirements)
   - IP Robust (6 requirements)
   - IC Basic (4 requirements)
   - IC Robust (8 requirements)
   - AP Basic (3 requirements)
   - AP Robust (7 requirements)
3. Test template insertion

**Verification Queries**:
```sql
-- Check templates were created for all roles and tiers
SELECT role, tier, template_name, requirements_count
FROM compliance_templates
ORDER BY role, tier;
```

**Expected Results**:
- 8 templates total (4 roles × 2 tiers)
- Each template has the correct number of requirements
- UI configuration data properly stored

### 4. Run Initialization Script

**Objective**: Initialize the system with completed components

**Steps**:
1. Create deployment script (per `Day1Implementation.md`)
2. Run initialization script to:
   - Execute any remaining database schema updates
   - Seed all requirement templates
   - Initialize user tiers based on roles
   - Assign requirements to users
3. Monitor execution logs

**Command**:
```bash
# Execute the initialization script
node src/scripts/deployComplianceSystem.js
```

**Expected Results**:
- Script runs without errors
- All templates properly seeded
- User profiles updated with compliance tiers
- Requirements assigned to users based on role/tier
- Audit logs created for initialization actions

### 5. Verification and Validation

**Objective**: Ensure all components are properly deployed and connected

**Steps**:
1. Verify database state
2. Test service methods with real data
3. Validate user requirements
4. Check template integrity

**Verification Queries and Tests**:
```sql
-- Check user compliance tiers
SELECT role, compliance_tier, COUNT(*) as user_count
FROM profiles
WHERE role IN ('IT', 'IP', 'IC', 'AP')
GROUP BY role, compliance_tier
ORDER BY role, compliance_tier;

-- Check requirement assignments
SELECT p.role, p.compliance_tier, COUNT(ucr.id) as requirements_count
FROM profiles p
JOIN user_compliance_records ucr ON p.id = ucr.user_id
GROUP BY p.role, p.compliance_tier
ORDER BY p.role, p.compliance_tier;
```

```typescript
// Test tier service with real user
const userId = '...'; // ID of a real user
const tierInfo = await ComplianceTierService.getUIComplianceTierInfo(userId);
console.log('User tier info:', tierInfo);

// Test requirements service with real user
const userRequirements = await ComplianceRequirementsService.getUIRequirements(
  userId,
  tierInfo.role,
  tierInfo.tier
);
console.log(`User has ${userRequirements.length} requirements`);
```

**Expected Results**:
- All users have appropriate compliance tiers
- Requirements are properly assigned to users
- Services return correct data
- UI-ready data structures are complete

## Rollback Plan

In case of deployment issues:

1. **Database Schema Rollback**:
   ```sql
   -- Drop new tables if needed
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS compliance_tier_history;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_compliance_records;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS compliance_requirements;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS compliance_templates;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS compliance_files;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS compliance_activity_log;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS compliance_review_history;
   
   -- Remove compliance_tier column from profiles
   ALTER TABLE profiles DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS compliance_tier;
   ```

2. **Service Code Rollback**:
   - Restore previous versions of service files from version control

## Success Criteria

Day 1 implementation is successful when:

1. ✅ Database schema is deployed with all tables, indexes, and constraints
2. ✅ ComplianceRequirementsService is fully implemented with all methods
3. ✅ Requirement templates are created for all roles and tiers
4. ✅ User profiles are updated with appropriate compliance tiers
5. ✅ Requirements are assigned to users based on their role and tier
6. ✅ Services can retrieve and format data for UI components

## Next Steps for Day 2

After successful Day 1 deployment:
1. Begin implementation of UI components
2. Integrate compliance services with dashboard
3. Implement role-specific dashboard routing
