  member_name: string;
  member_email: string;
  member_role: string;
  compliance_score: number;        // REAL score from ComplianceService
  compliance_status: string;       // REAL status calculation
  pending_actions: number;         // REAL count from compliance_actions
  overdue_actions: number;         // REAL count with date validation
  last_updated: string;

}
```

### **Provider Compliance Summary**
```typescript
interface ProviderComplianceSummary {
  provider_id: string;
  total_members: number;           // REAL count from database
  compliant_members: number;       // REAL aggregation
  warning_members: number;         // REAL aggregation
  non_compliant_members: number;   // REAL aggregation
  pending_members: number;         // REAL aggregation
  overall_compliance_rate: number; // REAL percentage calculation
  total_pending_actions: number;   // REAL count aggregation
  total_overdue_actions: number;   // REAL count aggregation
  compliance_breakdown: {          // REAL percentage breakdowns
    compliant_percentage: number;
    warning_percentage: number;
    non_compliant_percentage: number;
    pending_percentage: number;
