# Provider Location Team Architecture Analysis & Unified Solution

## üö® **Current Issues Identified**

Based on the Dashboard Integrity Panel findings showing 14% system health with critical assignment inconsistencies:

### **Fundamental Problems:**
1. **Dual Assignment Systems**: `authorized_providers.primary_location_id` vs `ap_user_location_assignments` are not synchronized
2. **Orphaned Teams**: Teams exist without proper provider assignments 
3. **Inconsistent Data Flow**: AP users show "provider record but missing location assignment"
4. **No Single Source of Truth**: Multiple tables managing the same relationships differently

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Proposed Unified Architecture**

### **Core Business Logic:**
```
AP User ‚Üí Location(s) ‚Üí Team(s) ‚Üí Provider Assignment ‚Üí Certificates/Operations
```

### **Single Source of Truth Model:**

#### **1. Primary Assignment Table: `ap_user_location_assignments`**
This becomes the **master record** for all AP user assignments:
```sql
ap_user_location_assignments:
- ap_user_id (FK to profiles)
- location_id (FK to locations) 
- assignment_role ('primary_provider', 'secondary_provider', 'supervisor')
- status ('active', 'inactive')
- effective_date, end_date
```

#### **2. Derived Provider Records: `authorized_providers`**
This becomes a **view/derived table** that auto-syncs from assignments:
```sql
authorized_providers:
- user_id (FK to profiles) 
- primary_location_id (derived from ap_user_location_assignments)
- status (derived from assignment status)
- Auto-created/updated via triggers
```

#### **3. Team-Location Binding: `teams`**
Teams are bound to locations, providers are derived:
```sql
teams:
- location_id (required - teams must belong to a location)
- provider_id (auto-assigned from location's primary AP user)
- team_type ('location_based', 'self_managed', 'cross_location')
```

## üìã **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Data Migration & Cleanup**
1. **Audit Current State**: Identify all inconsistencies
2. **Create Master Assignments**: Consolidate all assignments into `ap_user_location_assignments`
3. **Auto-Sync Provider Records**: Create triggers to maintain `authorized_providers`
4. **Fix Team Assignments**: Ensure all teams have proper location and provider links

### **Phase 2: Service Layer Unification**
1. **Single Assignment Service**: All assignments go through one service
2. **Cascading Updates**: Changes to AP assignments auto-update teams and providers
3. **Validation Logic**: Prevent orphaned records and inconsistent states

### **Phase 3: UI/UX Alignment**
1. **Provider Management Hub**: Shows unified assignment status
2. **Location Management**: Central control for all location-based operations
3. **Team Management**: Teams automatically inherit provider assignments

---

## üéØ **Unified Business Rules**

### **AP User Assignment Rules:**
1. **Primary Assignment**: Each AP user has one primary location assignment
2. **Secondary Assignments**: Can support multiple locations if needed
3. **Provider Record**: Auto-created when location assignment is made
4. **Team Inheritance**: Teams at AP user's location(s) automatically get provider assignment

### **Team Creation Rules:**
1. **Location Required**: All teams must be assigned to a location
2. **Auto Provider Assignment**: Provider auto-assigned from location's AP user
3. **Self-Managed Option**: Teams can opt out of provider oversight
4. **Cross-Location Teams**: Special handling for multi-location operations

### **Location Management Rules:**
1. **Primary AP User**: Each location has one primary AP user
2. **Team Oversight**: All location teams report to the primary AP user
3. **Certificate Flow**: Certificates flow through location ‚Üí team ‚Üí provider hierarchy

---

## üîß **Technical Implementation Plan**

### **Database Changes:**
```sql
-- 1. Make ap_user_location_assignments the master table
ALTER TABLE ap_user_location_assignments ADD COLUMN is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE ap_user_location_assignments ADD CONSTRAINT unique_primary_per_user 
    UNIQUE(ap_user_id) WHERE is_primary = true;

-- 2. Add triggers to auto-sync authorized_providers
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_authorized_providers()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Auto-create/update provider record when assignment changes
    INSERT INTO authorized_providers (user_id, primary_location_id, ...)
    ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET ...;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- 3. Add team provider auto-assignment
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auto_assign_team_provider()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Auto-assign provider when team location changes
    UPDATE teams SET provider_id = (
        SELECT ap.id FROM authorized_providers ap 
        JOIN ap_user_location_assignments ala ON ap.user_id = ala.ap_user_id
        WHERE ala.location_id = NEW.location_id AND ala.is_primary = true
    ) WHERE id = NEW.id;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### **Service Layer Changes:**
```typescript
// Unified Assignment Service
class UnifiedAssignmentService {
    // Single method for all AP user assignments
    async assignAPUserToLocation(apUserId: string, locationId: string, isPrimary: boolean) {
        // 1. Create/update ap_user_location_assignment
        // 2. Triggers auto-sync authorized_providers
        // 3. Triggers auto-assign teams at location
        // 4. Return unified status
    }
    
    // Single method for team creation
    async createTeam(teamData: TeamData) {
        // 1. Require location_id
        // 2. Auto-assign provider from location
        // 3. Validate assignments
        // 4. Return team with full relationship context
    }
}
```

### **UI/UX Changes:**
```typescript
// Provider Management Hub - Single Interface
- Location Assignment (primary action)
- Team Overview (auto-populated from assignments)
- Provider Status (derived from assignments)
- System Health (real-time validation)

// Team Management - Location-Centric
- Teams grouped by location
- Provider assignments visible and automatic
- Self-managed option clearly indicated
- Cross-location teams handled specially
```
