# COMPLETE AP USER COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SOLUTION

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

### 1. **Fixed RLS Policies**
- **AP User Visibility**: AP users can now see team member profiles (no more "Unknown User")
- **Role Separation**: Clear distinction between USER ROLES (IT/IP/IC/AP) and TEAM ROLES (MEMBER/ADMIN)
- **Secure Access**: Proper access control for compliance data management

### 2. **Working "Assign Requirements" Functionality**
```typescript
// Enhanced assignment process:
1. Initialize default requirements if missing
2. Fetch actual USER ROLE (not team role) from profiles
3. Assign role-based requirements to user
4. Refresh compliance data in real-time
```

### 3. **Real-Time Compliance Score Calculation**
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Calculated from visible template requirements
- **Weighted Average**: Based on requirement importance (Background Check: 25%, etc.)
- **Status Mapping**: Compliant=100pts, Warning=75pts, Non-compliant=0pts, Pending=50pts

### 4. **Comprehensive Document Upload System**
- **Secure Upload**: File upload with proper validation
- **RLS Protected**: Row-level security for all compliance documents
- **Status Integration**: Upload updates compliance status automatically

### 5. **Complete RLS Security Model**
```sql
-- Document Access Levels:
- SA/AD: Full access to all documents
- AP: Can manage team member documents
- Users: Can manage their own documents
- Team Members: Can view each other's documents (for oversight)
```

## üîß HOW IT WORKS

### **For AP Users Managing Team Compliance:**

1. **View Team Members**:

   - Displays 5 IC requirements for IC users, etc.

3. **Assign Requirements**: 
   - "Assign Requirements" button creates database records
   - Converts template requirements to active compliance tracking

4. **Update Status**: 
   - Dropdown menus to change requirement status
   - Real-time score updates

5. **Upload Documents**: 
   - Functional "Upload Doc" buttons for each requirement
   - Secure file storage with proper permissions
   - Automatic status updates on upload

### **Security Model:**
- **User Documents**: Users can only upload to their own compliance records
- **AP Oversight**: AP users can manage all team member documents
- **Admin Control**: SA/AD users have full system access
- **Audit Trail**: All document actions are logged and tracked
