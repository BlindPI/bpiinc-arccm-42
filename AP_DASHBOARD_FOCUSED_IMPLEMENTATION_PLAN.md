# **AP Dashboard Focused Implementation Plan**

## **🎯 Scope: Manage Team & View Reports Button Complete Implementation** 

**Focus Areas ONLY:**
1. **Fix Icon Visibility** - Restore missing icons in Overview tab action buttons
2. **Manage Team Button** - 100% functional workflow with real database integration  
3. **View Reports Button** - 100% functional analytics workflow with real database integration

**Explicitly OUT OF SCOPE:**
- ❌ Certificate Management (working as-is)
- ❌ Course Management (working as-is, routes to existing functionality)
- ❌ Other dashboard enhancements

## **📋 Phase 1: Icon Visibility Fix**
*Priority: Critical - 1 day*

### **1.1 Diagnose Icon Import Issue**
**Target File**: [`src/components/dashboard/ui/WorkingDashboardActionButton.tsx`](src/components/dashboard/ui/WorkingDashboardActionButton.tsx:26)

**Current Issue**: Action buttons show blank squares instead of icons

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Verify lucide-react icon imports in WorkingDashboardActionButton
2. Check icon prop passing from EnhancedProviderDashboard
3. Validate icon rendering in button component
4. Test all 4 action button icons: Calendar, Users, Award, ClipboardList

**Expected Outcome**: All action buttons display proper icons

- **Current Issue**: Provider Team Management shows placeholder: *"Provider team creation form will be implemented here"*
- **Required**: 100% functional team management workflow with real database operations
