# Dashboard Query Impact Analysis
*Analysis of switching from team_members to provider_team_assignments*

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Identified Dashboard Services Using team_members

Based on code analysis, the following services currently use [`team_members`](src/services/team) extensively:

#### Core Dashboard Services
- [`dashboardDataService.ts`](src/services/dashboard/dashboardDataService.ts) - System admin, AP user, team-scoped metrics
- [`teamScopedAnalyticsService.ts`](src/services/analytics/teamScopedAnalyticsService.ts) - Team-restricted dashboard metrics
- [`realTimeAnalyticsService.ts`](src/services/analytics/realTimeAnalyticsService.ts) - Executive dashboard data
- [`certificateMetricsService.ts`](src/services/certificates/certificateMetricsService.ts) - Certificate dashboard metrics

#### Provider Services
- [`providerRelationshipService.ts`](src/services/provider/providerRelationshipService.ts) - Provider location KPIs
- [`ProviderRelationshipService_FIXED.ts`](src/services/provider/ProviderRelationshipService_FIXED.ts) - Fixed version
- [`unifiedProviderService.ts`](src/services/provider/unifiedProviderService.ts) - Unified provider operations

#### Team Management Services
- 15+ team services using [`team_members`](src/services/team) queries
- Complex joins with profiles, teams, and locations
- Multiple bulk operations and member management functions

### 2. Current Query Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Member Count Queries
```typescript
// Current approach - Multiple queries needed
const { count: memberCount } = await supabase
  .from('team_members')
  .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
  .eq('team_id', teamId)
  .eq('status', 'active');
```

#### Pattern 2: Complex Dashboard Joins
```typescript
// Current approach - Complex 3-table join
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('team_members')
  .select(`
    user_id,
    role,
    teams!team_members_team_id_fkey(
      id,
      name,
      location_id,
      locations(name)
    ),
    profiles!team_members_user_id_fkey(
      display_name,
      role
    )
  `)
  .eq('status', 'active');
```

#### Pattern 3: Provider Dashboard Queries
```typescript
// Current approach - Indirect relationship
const assignmentsWithMemberCounts = await Promise.all((data || []).map(async (assignment) => {
  const memberResult = await supabase
    .from('team_members')
    .select('id', { count: 'exact' })
    .eq('team_id', assignment.team_id)
    .eq('status', 'active');
  
  return {
    ...assignment,
    member_count: memberResult.count || 0
  };
}));
```

### 3. Identified Performance Issues

#### Issue 1: Multiple Round-trip Queries
```typescript
// From diagnoseTeamLoadingPerformance.ts
// Current approach requires multiple queries for dashboard data
```

#### Issue 2: Complex Member Counting
```typescript
// From diagnoseMemberCount.ts
// Double counting issues due to complex team relationships
const dashboardCount = primaryLocationMemberCount + assignedTeamsMemberCount;
```

#### Issue 3: RLS Policy Complexity
```typescript
// From diagnoseAPTeamMemberAccess.ts
// Complex RLS policies causing access issues
```

## Simplified Implementation Impact

### 1. Query Simplification

#### New Pattern 1: Direct Assignment Query
```typescript
// Simplified approach - Single query
const { data: assignments } = await supabase
  .from('provider_team_assignments')
  .select(`
    assignment_role,
    oversight_level,
    teams!inner(
      id,
      name,
      performance_score,
      locations!inner(id, name)
    )
  `)
  .eq('provider_id', providerId)
  .eq('status', 'active');
```

#### New Pattern 2: Direct Dashboard Data
```typescript
// Simplified approach - No member counting needed
const dashboardData = await supabase.rpc('get_provider_dashboard_data', {
  provider_uuid: providerId
});
```

#### New Pattern 3: Role-Based Access
```typescript
// Simplified approach - Built-in role hierarchy
const canManage = assignment.oversight_level === 'admin';
const canView = ['manage', 'admin'].includes(assignment.oversight_level);
```

### 2. Services Requiring Updates

#### High Priority - Core Dashboard Services
1. **[`dashboardDataService.ts`](src/services/dashboard/dashboardDataService.ts)**
   - **Impact**: Complete rewrite of metrics functions
   - **Effort**: High (3-4 days)

### 3. Breaking Changes Analysis

#### Database Queries
```typescript
// BREAKING: These queries will need updates
supabase.from('team_members')        // → provider_team_assignments
.select('user_id, team_id, role')    // → provider_id, team_id, assignment_role
```

#### Data Structures
```typescript
// BREAKING: Interface changes needed
interface TeamMember {               // OLD
  user_id: string;
  team_id: string;
  role: 'MEMBER' | 'MANAGER' | 'ADMIN';
}

interface ProviderTeamAssignment {   // NEW
  provider_id: string;
  team_id: string;
  assignment_role: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'supervisor' | 'coordinator';
  oversight_level: 'monitor' | 'standard' | 'manage' | 'admin';
}
```

#### Component Props
```typescript
// BREAKING: Component interfaces need updates
interface DashboardProps {
  teamMembers: TeamMember[];         // OLD
}

interface DashboardProps {
  assignments: ProviderTeamAssignment[]; // NEW
}
```
