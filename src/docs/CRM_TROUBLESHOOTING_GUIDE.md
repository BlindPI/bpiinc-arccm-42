# CRM Troubleshooting Guide
**Issue:** CRM leads cannot be saved - 500 console error  
**Root Cause:** Missing database tables and RLS policies  
**Status:** RESOLVED - Database schema created

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

### **Problem Description**
The CRM component was experiencing 500 errors when attempting to save leads. Users with SA (System Administrator) and AD (Administrator) roles were unable to create, update, or manage CRM data.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Missing Database Tables:** The CRM frontend code was attempting to access database tables (`crm_leads`, `crm_opportunities`, `crm_activities`, etc.) that did not exist in the database schema.

2. **No RLS Policies:** Even if tables existed, there were no Row Level Security (RLS) policies defined for CRM data access.

3. **Frontend-Backend Mismatch:** The frontend CRM components were fully implemented but the backend database infrastructure was missing.

## üîß SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### **Database Schema Created**
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250605_create_crm_tables.sql`

#### **Tables Created:**
1. **`crm_leads`** - Lead management and tracking
2. **`crm_opportunities`** - Sales opportunity pipeline
3. **`crm_activities`** - Customer interaction tracking
4. **`crm_tasks`** - Follow-up task management
5. **`crm_email_campaigns`** - Marketing campaign tracking
6. **`crm_pipeline_stages`** - Sales pipeline configuration
7. **`crm_revenue_records`** - Revenue tracking and analytics
8. **`crm_lead_scoring_rules`** - Automated lead scoring
9. **`crm_assignment_rules`** - Lead assignment automation
10. **`crm_analytics_cache`** - Performance optimization cache

### **RLS Policies Implemented**
All CRM tables now have proper Row Level Security policies that allow:

#### **System Administrators (SA) and Administrators (AD):**
- **Full Access:** Can view, create, update, and delete all CRM records
- **Cross-User Access:** Can manage records assigned to other users
- **Administrative Control:** Complete CRM system management

#### **Regular Users:**
- **Limited Access:** Can only view and update records assigned to them
- **Own Records:** Can manage their own created activities and tasks
- **Security Boundary:** Cannot access other users' CRM data

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Indexes:** Created on frequently queried columns (email, status, dates)
- **Triggers:** Automatic `updated_at` timestamp management
- **Constraints:** Data validation at database level
- **Foreign Keys:** Proper relational integrity

## üìã VERIFICATION STEPS

### **1. Database Migration**
Run the migration to create all CRM tables:
```sql
-- Apply the migration
supabase db push
```

### **2. Test CRM Functionality**
1. **Login as SA or AD user**
2. **Navigate to CRM section**
3. **Create a new lead:**
   - First Name: "Test"
   - Last Name: "Lead"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Company: "Test Company"
   - Status: "new"
   - Source: "website"

### **3. Verify Data Persistence**
- Check that lead appears in leads table
- Verify lead can be updated
- Confirm lead can be deleted
- Test opportunity creation from lead

### **4. Test Role-Based Access**
- **SA/AD users:** Should have full CRM access
- **Regular users:** Should only see assigned records
- **Unauthorized users:** Should receive proper access denied messages

## üîç DEBUGGING COMMANDS

### **Check Table Creation**
```sql
-- Verify all CRM tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'crm_%';
```

### **Check RLS Policies**
```sql
-- Verify RLS policies are active
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename LIKE 'crm_%';
```

### **Test Data Access**
```sql
-- Test basic lead query (should work for SA/AD)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM crm_leads;

-- Test lead insertion
INSERT INTO crm_leads (first_name, last_name, email, company_name) 
VALUES ('Test', 'User', 'test@test.com', 'Test Corp');
```

## üö® COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### **Issue 1: "relation 'crm_leads' does not exist"**
**Solution:** Run the database migration
```bash
supabase db push
```

### **Issue 2: "permission denied for table crm_leads"**
**Solution:** Check user role in profiles table
```sql
SELECT id, email, role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

### **Issue 3: "RLS policy violation"**
**Solution:** Verify user has SA or AD role
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'SA' WHERE email = 'your-email@domain.com';
```

### **Issue 4: "Cannot insert null value"**
**Solution:** Check required fields in CRM forms
- Email is required for leads
- Subject is required for activities
- Task title is required for tasks

## üìä DATA MODEL OVERVIEW

### **Lead Lifecycle**
```
Lead Created ‚Üí Contacted ‚Üí Qualified ‚Üí Opportunity Created ‚Üí Closed Won/Lost
```

### **Key Relationships**
- **Leads** ‚Üí **Opportunities** (1:many)
- **Opportunities** ‚Üí **Activities** (1:many)
- **Leads** ‚Üí **Activities** (1:many)
- **Users** ‚Üí **Leads** (assigned_to)
- **Users** ‚Üí **Opportunities** (assigned_to)

### **Scoring System**
- Leads automatically scored based on configurable rules
- Default rules included for company size, job title, source
